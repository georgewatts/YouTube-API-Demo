## A simple iOS demo for YouTube API

---
Updated to be compatible with Swift 4. There are still issues with layouts and functions, however the core YouTube video functionality has been updated.

My next objectives:
* Tidy up the layout to stop errors in the console
* Change the aspect ratio of the YTPlayerView
* Create an instance of YTPlayerView delegate and demonstrate the delegate functions

This is a simple demo that shows you how to integrate your app with YouTube API. You can 
find the full tutorial here:

To run the demo, you will need to create your own API key first and update the following line of code in ViewController.swift:
```swift
var apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```
