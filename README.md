#A simple iOS demo for YouTube API

❗️ Updated to Swift 3 - Currently no plans to update to Swift 4 but I am hoping to do it eventually. I've tried to keep the format of the file the same, most of the broken code is just commented out so you can see the changes.

This is a simple demo that shows you how to integrate your app with YouTube API. You can 
find the full tutorial here:

To run the demo, you will need to create your own API key first and update the following line of code in ViewController.swift:

  var apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
